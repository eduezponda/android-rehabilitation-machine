Rehabilitation Machine Simulation Project

Overview

This project consists of two interconnected Android applications that simulate the behavior of a rehabilitation machine. 
The applications provide real-time status updates of the machine, historical data, and an interface to simulate the machine's behavior. 
Additionally, the project includes a feature to capture photos. Both applications are connected to a backend database hosted on Back4App. 
The project utilizes a Data Access Object (DAO) to manage all database interactions.

Features

    Real-time Status Monitoring: View the current state of the rehabilitation machine.
    Historical Data: Access historical data of the machine's performance and usage.
    Simulation Interface: Simulate the machine's behavior through a user-friendly interface.
    Photo Capture: Capture photos and store them within the app.
    Backend Connectivity: Both applications are connected to a Back4App backend database.
    DAO Integration: A Data Access Object (DAO) handles all database operations, ensuring clean and organized code.
